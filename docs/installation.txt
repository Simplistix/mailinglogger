Installation Instructions
=========================

The easyiest way to install MailingLogger is::

  easy_install mailinglogger

Or, if you're using `zc.buildout`, just specify ``mailinglogger`` as a
required egg. 

.. note:: 

  Due to a bug in Python 2.5.0, SummarisingLogger requires a
  any version of Python with the logging framework present
  *other* than 2.5.0
